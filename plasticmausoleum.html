        <p>​​Standing in the Lukewarm, TV Static Salt Bath of the Target Baking Aisle,</p><br>
        <p>I stare at the colored mini marshmallows<br>
        and think about my sister, who sometimes<br>
        melted the pastel pink, orange and yellows<br>
        on top of her hot cocoa like a doll house sunset, <br>
        but more often ate them straight from the bag<br>
        alone in her purple room<br>
        that smelled so badly of the medicine, <br>
        like curdled milk on her breath,<br>
        but at least her room wasn’t bleached clean</p><br>
        <p>like this fluorescent emptiness<br>
        with people beeping all around me,<br>
        and announcements in calm women's voices<br>
        breaking the all-consuming, sterile<br>
        light, and if I closed my eyes<br>
        I wouldn't see the marshmallows anymore,<br>
        but the marshmallows are the only thing<br>
        that don't feel like the ICU,<br>
        and there is buzzing behind my eyes,<br>
        which are dry because I haven't blinked<br>
        since I saw the mini marshmallows,<br>
        tucked away in their plastic home,<br>
        screaming about what they aren’t,<br>
        and my roommate asks if I’m okay,<br>
        so I stumble on, and outside<br>
        the intravenous sunset<br>
        drips onto the pavement.</p>
